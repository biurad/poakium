# A robust package for loading files, classes, class aliases, annotations, and store data loader...

This dependency provides a few fluent and convenient wrappers for working files, class aliases, annotations, classes with a data loader that collect's data (scalar, object, array) and then populate's the data into object mapping.

**`Please note that this documentation is currently work-in-progress. Feel free to contribute.`**

## Installation

The recommended way to install Loader Manager is via Composer:

```bash
composer require biurad/biurad-loader
```

It requires PHP version 7.0 and supports PHP up to 7.4. The dev-master version requires PHP 7.1.

## How To Use

Loader manager offers a very intuitive API for scalables, null, array and object manipulation. Before we show you the first example, we need to think about how to pack all our configurations into one collection and easily access it as string, object or and array without having to define configurations over and over. Including loading classes, class aliases, or annotations.

All Loader manager classes are very well optimized for performance and in the first place, it provides full atomicity of operations.

Before using this dependency, take some time to familiarize yourself with [Php ArrayAccess](http://php.net/manual/en/arrayaccess.php), [Doctrine Annotations](https://github.com/doctrine/annotations), [PHP class_alias function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.class-alias.php), [PHP RecursiveDirectoryIterator](http://php.net/manual/en/recursivedirectoryiterator.php) and [PHP SplFileInfo](http://php.net/manual/en/splfileinfo.php). and handling stored variables in php.

The Loader Manager has some useful classes and methods which you may require while working on a project.
