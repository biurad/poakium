**biurad/biurad-caching** is a php cache library based on [Doctrine Cache][] created by [Divine Niiquaye][@divineniiquaye] which supports many different drivers such as redis, memcache, apc, mongodb and others. Implemented in [PSR-6] and [PSR-16] for great interoperability, performance and resiliency.

## üì¶ Installation & Basic Usage

This project requires PHP 7.1 or higher. The recommended way to install, is via [Composer]. Simply run:

```bash
$ composer require biurad/biurad-caching
```

This library is designed in an interoperable manner. Using [PSR-16] caching implementation, requires a [Doctrine Cache][] adapter, while [PSR-6] requires [PSR-16].

```php
// you can use any of doctrine cache adapter
$storage = new Biurad\Cache\AdapterFactory::createHandler('array');
// or
$storage = new Doctrine\Common\Cache\ArrayCache();
```

The `Doctrine\Common\Cache\Cache` storage is very simple for performance and in the first place, it provides full atomicity of operations.

| Strategy                      | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| BiuradPHP\Cache\SimpleCache   | For [PSR-16] caching abilities using doctrine cache adapter |
| BiuradPHP\Cache\CacheItemPool | For [PSR-6] caching abilities using [PSR-16]                |
| BiuradPHP\Cache\FastCache     | For advance and optimized [PSR-16]/[PSR-6] caching strategy |
| BiuradPHP\Cache\MemoryCache   | For caching using `var_export`                              |
| BiuradPHP\Cache\Preloader     | For PHP 7.4 opache.preload abilities                        |

Now you can create, retrieve, update and delete items using the above caching classes except `Preloader` class:

### For manipulation with cache using [PSR-16], we use the `Biurad\Cache\SimpleCache`:

---

If you want a quick caching strategy for your application, use [PSR-16] caching strategy. Its so simple and straight forward.

```php
use Biurad\Cache\SimpleCache;

$cache = new SimpleCache($storage); // psr-16 caching
```

```php
// assign a value to the item and save it
$cache->set('stats.products_count', 4711);

// retrieve the cache item
$productsCount = $cache->get('stats.products_count');

if (null === $productsCount) {
    // ... item does not exist in the cache
}

// retrieve the value stored by the item
$total = $productsCount;

// remove the cache item
$cache->delete('stats.products_count');
```

### For manipulation with cache using [PSR-16], we use the `Biurad\Cache\CacheItemPool`:

---

If you want a bit advanced caching stratagy above [PSR-16], [PSR-6] is what you need, has a cool way of invalidating a missed cache.

```php
use BiuradPHP\Cache\CacheItemPool;

$cache = new CacheItemPool($cache); // psr-16 cache in psr-6 cache.
```

```php
// create a new item by trying to get it from the cache
$productsCount = $cache->getItem('stats.products_count');

// assign a value to the item and save it
$productsCount->set(4711);
$cache->save($productsCount);

// retrieve the cache item
$productsCount = $cache->getItem('stats.products_count');

if (!$productsCount->isHit()) {
    // ... item does not exist in the cache
}

// retrieve the value stored by the item
$total = $productsCount->get();

// remove the cache item
$cache->deleteItem('stats.products_count');
```

### For manipulation with cache using `var_export`, we use the `BiuradPHP\Cache\MemoryCache`:

---

```php
use BiuradPHP\Cache\MemoryCache;

$cache = new MemoryCache(getcwd() . '/memory_cache');
```

```php
// assign a value to the item and save it
$products = [...]; // An array of products
$cache->saveData('stats.products', $products);

if (null === $productsCount) {
    // ... item does not exist in the cache
}

// retrieve the value stored by the item
$total = $cache->loadData('stats.products');

// Remove cache item, by deleting the cache file.
```

### For manipulation with cache using an advanced caching system, we use the `BiuradPHP\Cache\FastCache`:

---

For each method in `BiuradPHP\Cache\FastCache` class that has a second parameter as `callable`, which is called when there is no such item in the cache. This callback receives 2 arguments at the end by reference. The `Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface` and a boolean, which you can use for setting expiration rules and saving data into cache.

```php
use BiuradPHP\Cache\CacheItemPool;
use BiuradPHP\Cache\SimpleCache;
use BiuradPHP\Cache\FastCache;

// you can use any of doctrine cache adapter
$storage = new Doctrine\Common\Cache\ArrayCache();

$psr6 = new CacheItemPool($psr16 = new SimpleCache($storage)); // psr-16 cache in psr-6 cache.

$cache = new FastCache($psr16);
//or
$cache = new FastCache($psr6);
```

The first argument of the `load()` method is a key, an arbitrary string that you associate to the cached value so you can retrieve it later. The second argument is a PHP callable which is executed when the key is not found in the cache to generate and return the value:

```php
use Psr\Cache\CacheItemIterface;

// The callable will only be executed on a cache miss.
$value = $cache->load('my_cache_key', function (CacheItemInterface $item) {
    $item->expiresAfter(3600);

    // ... do some HTTP request or heavy computations
    $computedValue = 'foobar';

    return $computedValue;
});

echo $value; // 'foobar'

// ... and to remove the cache key
$cache->delete('my_cache_key');
```

The callable caching feature. Caching the result of a function or method call can be achieved using the `call()` method:

```php
$name = $cache->call('gethostbyaddr', $ip);
```

The `gethostbyaddr($ip)` will, therefore, be called only once and next time, only the value from cache will be returned. Of course, for different `$ip`, different results are cached. But if you want to set expiry time on call, add `Psr\Cache\CacheItemInterface` argument at the end and set the expiration time.

Similarly, it is possible to wrap a function with cache and call it later.

```php
function calculate($number)
{
	return 'number is ' . $number;
}

$wrapper = $cache->wrap('calculate');

$result = $wrapper(1); // number is 1
$result = $wrapper(2); // number is 2
```

The template/output caching feature. Caching the result of an output can be cached not only in templates:

```php
if ($block = $cache->start($key)) {
	... printing some data ...

	$block->end(); // save the output to the cache
}
```

In case that the output is already present in the cache, the `start()` method prints it and returns `null`. Otherwise, it starts to buffer the output and returns the `$block` object using which we finally save the data to the cache.

The expiration and invalidation caching feature.

This feature works with only PSR-6 cache, By default the beta is 1.0 and higher values mean earlier recompute. Set it to 0 to disable early recompute and set it to INF to force an immediate recompute:

```php
use Psr\Cache\CacheItemIterface;

$beta = 1.0;
$value = $cache->save('my_cache_key', function (CacheItemInterface $item) {
    $item->expiresAfter(3600);

    return '...';
}, $beta);
```

### For manipulation of PHP 7.4 opcache preload feature, we use the `BiuradPHP\Cache\Preloader`:

---

Starting from PHP 7.4, OPcache can compile and load classes at start-up and make them available to all requests until the server is restarted, improving performance significantly.

```php
use BiuradPHP\Cache\Preloader;

$preloadClasses = [...]; // A list array of classes to be appended for preloading.
$preloadFile = getcwd().'/opcache.preload.php'; // The file preloaded classes to fetch from.

Preloader::append($preloadFile, $preloadClasses);

// to check opcache preload statistics
var_dump(Preloader::getStatistics());
```

After the `$preloadFile` is written into, set the following configuration in your php.ini file:

```ini
; php.ini
opcache.preload=/path/to/opcache.preload.php

; maximum memory that OPcache can use to store compiled PHP files
opcache.memory_consumption=256

; maximum number of files that can be stored in the cache
opcache.max_accelerated_files=20000
```
