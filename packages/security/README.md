# A Security system that provides authentication, authorization and a role-based access control management plus more

Symfony's security system is incredibly powerful, but it can also be confusing to set up and use. Not only that, It requires a whole lot of packages from symfony which is not mostly un used. This package utilizes Symfony security system as standalone, but for now, only supports BiuradPHP and Nette Framework projects.


**`Please note that you can get the documentation for this dependency on symfony website, security-http`**

The recommended way to install Security Manager is via Composer:

```bash
composer require biurad/biurad-security
