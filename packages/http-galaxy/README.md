**biurad/http-galaxy** is a fast, and simple [PSR-7] implementation for [PHP] 7.2+ based on [symfony/http-foundation] created by [Divine Niiquaye][@divineniiquaye]. This library seeks to add [PSR-7] support directly to [symfony/http-foundation] allowing the developer accessing both objects in one. It also shipped with [PSR-15] and [PSR-17] support.

## üì¶ Installation & Basic Usage

This project requires [PHP] 7.3 or higher. The recommended way to install, is via [Composer]. Simply run:

```bash
$ composer require biurad/http-galaxy
```

## üìì Documentation

For in-depth documentation before using this library.. Full documentation on advanced usage, configuration, and customization can be found at [docs.biurad.com][docs].

## ‚è´ Upgrading

Information on how to upgrade to newer versions of this library can be found in the [UPGRADE].

## üè∑Ô∏è Changelog

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is followed closely. Minor and patch releases should not introduce breaking changes to the codebase; See [CHANGELOG] for more information on what has changed recently.

Any classes or methods marked `@internal` are not intended for use outside of this library and are subject to breaking changes at any time, so please avoid using them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Support

(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)

- A new **patch version released** (e.g. `1.0.10`, `1.1.6`) comes out roughly every month. It only contains bug fixes, so you can safely upgrade your applications.
- A new **minor version released** (e.g. `1.1`, `1.2`) comes out every six months: one in June and one in December. It contains bug fixes and new features, but it doesn‚Äôt include any breaking change, so you can safely upgrade your applications;
- A new **major version released** (e.g. `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`) comes out every two years. It can contain breaking changes, so you may need to do some changes in your applications before upgrading.

When a **major** version is released, the number of minor versions is limited to five per branch (X.0, X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4). The last minor version of a branch (e.g. 1.4, 2.4) is considered a **long-term support (LTS) version** with lasts for more that 2 years and the other ones cam last up to 8 months:
