             * This ensures several things in case the developer did not save the session explicitly:
             *
             *  * If a session save handler without locking is used, it ensures the data is available
             *    on the next request, e.g. after a redirect. PHPs auto-save at script end via
             *    session_register_shutdown is executed after fastcgi_finish_request. So in this case
             *    the data could be missing the next request because it might not be saved the moment
             *    the new request is processed.
             *  * A locking save handler (e.g. the native 'files') circumvents concurrency problems like
             *    the one above. we ensure the session is not blocked longer than needed.
             *  * When regenerating the session ID no locking is involved in PHPs session design. See
             *    https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=61470 for a discussion. So in this case, the session must
             *    be saved anyway before sending the headers with the new session ID. Otherwise session
             *    data could get lost again for concurrent requests with the new ID. One result could be
             *    that you get logged out after just logging in.
             *
             * This Middleware should be executed as one of the last Middlewares, so that previous Middlewares
             * can still operate on the open session. This prevents the overhead of restarting it.
             * Middlewares after closing the session can still work with the session as usual because
             * Biurad session implementation starts the session on demand. So writing to it after
             * it is saved will just restart it.
